A keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware designed to record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:

How Keyloggers Work

Keyloggers can be installed through various methods, such as phishing emails, malicious websites, or physical access to the device. They can be either software-based or hardware-based.

Once installed, the keylogger runs in the background, capturing every keystroke made by the user. This includes everything from passwords and credit card numbers to emails and chat messages.

Data Transmission: The recorded keystrokes are then sent to the attacker. This can be done through email, FTP, or other methods, depending on the keylogger’s configuration.

Stealth Operation: Keyloggers are designed to operate stealthily, often avoiding detection by antivirus software. Some advanced keyloggers can even capture screenshots, monitor clipboard activity, and record other types of user interactions12.



Types of Keyloggers

Software Keyloggers: These are programs installed on the target device. They can be further categorized into:

API-based Keyloggers: Use the system’s API to capture keystrokes.

Form Grabbing Keyloggers: Capture data submitted in web forms.

Kernel-based Keyloggers: Operate at the kernel level, making them harder to detect.

Hardware Keyloggers: These are physical devices attached to the computer, such as a USB stick or a device placed between the keyboard and the computer2.
Legal and Malicious Uses

Legal Uses: Employers might use keyloggers to monitor employee activity, and parents might use them to keep track of their children’s online behavior.

Malicious Uses: Cybercriminals use keyloggers to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data13.





Protection Against Keyloggers

Use Antivirus Software: Regularly update and run antivirus software to detect and remove keyloggers.

Enable Two-Factor Authentication: Adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.

Be Cautious with Downloads: Avoid downloading software from untrusted sources and be wary of phishing attempts3.
